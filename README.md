**Manual Installation**

The class file required for PageMenu is located in the Classes folder in the root of this repository as listed below:

* <code>CAPSPageMenu.swift<code>

## How to use PageMenu

First you will have to create a view controller that is supposed to serve as the base of the page menu. This can be a view controller with its xib file as a separate file as well as having its xib file in storyboard. Following this you will have to go through a few simple steps outlined below in order to get everything up and running.

1)  Add the files listed in the installation section to your project

2)  Add a property for CAPSPageMenu in your base view controller

```swift
var pageMenu : CAPSPageMenu?
```

3)  Add the following code in the viewDidAppear function in your view controller

```swift
// Array to keep track of controllers in page menu
var controllerArray : [UIViewController] = []

// Create variables for all view controllers you want to put in the 
// page menu, initialize them, and add each to the controller array. 
// (Can be any UIViewController subclass)
// Make sure the title property of all view controllers is set
// Example:
var controller : UIViewController = UIViewController(nibName: "controllerNibName", bundle: nil)
controller.title = "SAMPLE TITLE"
controllerArray.append(controller)

// Initialize page menu with the controllers
pageMenu = CAPSPageMenu(viewControllers: controllerArray)

// Set frame for page menu
// Example:
pageMenu!.view.frame = CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, self.view.frame.width, self.view.frame.height)

// Customize page menu to your liking (optional) or use default settings
// Example:
pageMenu!.scrollMenuBackgroundColor = UIColor(red: 30.0/255.0, green: 30.0/255.0, blue: 30.0/255.0, alpha: 1.0)
pageMenu!.viewBackgroundColor = UIColor(red: 20.0/255.0, green: 20.0/255.0, blue: 20.0/255.0, alpha: 1.0)
pageMenu!.selectionIndicatorColor = UIColor.orangeColor()
pageMenu!.bottomMenuHairlineColor = UIColor(red: 70.0/255.0, green: 70.0/255.0, blue: 80.0/255.0, alpha: 1.0)
pageMenu!.menuItemFont = UIFont(name: "HelveticaNeue", size: 13.0)
pageMenu!.menuHeight = 40.0

// Lastly add page menu as subview of base view controller view
// or use pageMenu controller in you view hierachy as desired
self.view.addSubview(pageMenu!.view)
```

4)  You should now be ready to use PageMenu!! ðŸŽ‰
