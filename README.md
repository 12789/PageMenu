## Installation

**Cocoa Pods**

Coming in the future.

**Manual Installation**

The classes required for CAPSPageMenu are located in the CAPSPageMenu folder in the root of this repository as listed below:

* <code>CAPSPageMenu.swift<code>
* <code>CAPSPageMenu.xib<code>

## How to use CAPSPageMenu

First you will have to create a view controller that is supposed to serve as the base of the page menu. This can be a view controller with its xib file as a separate file as well as having its xib file in storyboard. Following this you will have to go through a few simple steps outlined below in order to get everything up and running.

1)  Add the files listed in the installation section to your project

2)  Add a property for CAPSPageMenu in your base view controller

```swift
var pageMenu : CAPSPageMenu?
```

3)  Add the following code in the viewDidAppear function in your view controller

```swift
// Array to keep track of controllers in page menu
var controllerArray : [UIViewController] = []

// Create variables for all view controllers you want to put in the page menu, initialize them, and add each to the controller array. 
// Make sure the title property of all view controllers is set
// Example:
var controller : TestViewController = TestViewController(nibName: "TestViewController", bundle: nil)
controller.title = "SAMPLE TITLE"
controllerArray.append(controller)

// Initialize page menu with the controllers
pageMenu = CAPSPageMenu(viewControllers: controllerArray)

// Set frame for page menu
// Example:
pageMenu!.view.frame = CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, self.view.frame.width, self.view.frame.height)

// Customize page menu to your liking (optional) or use default settings
// Example:
pageMenu!.scrollMenuBackgroundColor = UIColor(red: 30.0/255.0, green: 30.0/255.0, blue: 30.0/255.0, alpha: 1.0)
pageMenu!.viewBackgroundColor = UIColor(red: 20.0/255.0, green: 20.0/255.0, blue: 20.0/255.0, alpha: 1.0)
pageMenu!.selectionIndicatorColor = UIColor.orangeColor()
pageMenu!.bottomMenuHairlineColor = UIColor(red: 70.0/255.0, green: 70.0/255.0, blue: 80.0/255.0, alpha: 1.0)
pageMenu!.menuItemFont = UIFont(name: "HelveticaNeue", size: 13.0)
pageMenu!.menuHeight = 40.0

// Lastly add page menu as subview of base view controller view
self.view.addSubview(pageMenu!.view)
```

4)  You should now be ready to use CAPSPageMenu!! ðŸŽ‰

## Customization

There are many ways you are able to customize page menu for your needs and there will be more customizations coming in the future to make sure page menu conforms to your app design. These will all be properties in CAPSPageMenu that can be changed from your base view controller. (Property names given with each item below)

1)  Colors

  * Background color behind the page menu scroll view to blend in view controller backgrounds 

        var pageMenu : CAPSPageMenu?

  * Scroll menu background color
  * Selection indicator color
  * Selected menu item label color
  * Unselected menu item label color
  * Bottom menu hairline color

2)  Dimensions

  * Scroll menu height
  * Scroll menu margin (leading space before first menu item and after last menu item as well as in between items)
  * Scroll menu item width
  * Selection indicator height

3)  Others
  * Menu item title label font
  * Bottom menu hairline

## Future Work

- [ ] No xib file required
- [ ] Objective-C version
- [ ] Screen rotation support
- [ ] More customization options
